This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[**Rollup**](https://rollupjs.org) is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application.

Plugins:

- **@rollup/plugin-babel**: Compile your files with Babel
- **@rollup/plugin-image**: Import JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, and WebP files
- **@rollup/plugin-node-resolve**: Locate and bundle third-party dependencies in node_modules
- **@rollup/plugin-url**: Import files as data-URIs or ES Modules
- **@svgr/rollup**: import your SVG directly as a React Component.
